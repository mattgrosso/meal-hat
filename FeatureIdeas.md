- I should probably put back a way to delete meals from the schedule.
  If I do that I should make sure that their timers get reset.
  Also, when I do that I should maybe automatically update the frequency value for that meal.
- Now that I'm using Firebase for auth I should consider using other auth platforms
- When you're adding things to the grocery list it would be nice if they auto suggested items that are already in your list.
  Really, it should be one input that lets you filter and add.
- I added that toast component, I should use it more often.
- When a user deletes a hat we should check if that hat exists for anyone else still. If no one is using it we should delete it for good.
  Also, this will mean each hat will need a list of users just like each user has a list of hats.
